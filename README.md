4. **Use familiar tools** - Stick to technologies you know well under time pressure
5. **Plan your demo** - Have a backup plan if live demos fail
6. **Document everything** - Good README files and screenshots matter for judging
7. **Network with teammates** - Great connections often matter more than winning
